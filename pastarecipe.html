      <h1>Pasta</h1>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>8 ounces penne pasta</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onion (about 1 large onion)</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Dash red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme, or a pinch of dried</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (16% fat)</li>
        <li>
          2 1/2 cups canned chunky tomato sauce (almost one 28-ounce can, Muir
          Glen brand if you can get it)
        </li>
        <li>3 fresh basil leaves, chopped, or 1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat to boiling a large pot with 4 quarts of water in it. Once the
          water is boiling, salt it with 2 tablespoons of salt. Once the water
          returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot. Leave uncovered, let cook
          on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8 to 10
          minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al
          dente (cooked but still a little firm). Drain.
        </li>

        <li>
          Once you've started to heat the water, start working on the sauce.
          Heat olive oil in a very large skillet on medium heat. Add the chopped
          onion, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Cook for 5 minutes,
          stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened. Add the garlic,
          fresh thyme, season with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional
          minute, until the garlic is fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
          Heat a large cast iron pan on high heat. Salt the bottom of the pan
          generously. Once the pan is hot, break up small chunks of ground beef
          and add them to the pan, without stirring. (You may need to work in
          batches; do not crowd the pan.) You want the meat to get well browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the pan is too hot and the meat is burning, not browning, take the
          pan off the heat for a little, and reduce the heat to medium high. On
          our coil electric stove, it takes the high heat setting for the meat
          to brown sufficiently, but your stove may be different. Once the meat
          is browned on one side (a couple of minutes), use a metal spatula to
          flip the meat over to brown on the other side. At this point, assuming
          you are using a cast iron pan, you can remove the pan from the heat.
          The residual heat in the pan will finish cooking the meat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a slotted spoon to lift the meat from the cast iron pan and add it
          to the pan with the seasoned onions. Add tomato sauce. Use the edge of
          your metal spatula to break up the bigger chunks of meat into smaller
          pieces. Add basil. Add a teaspoon of sugar. Bring to a simmer on low
          heat, let cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, adjust seasonings. Add
          salt and pepper to taste. Add a little more sugar if the sauce is too
          acidic. Add more tomato sauce if the sauce is a little dry. Stir in
          the cooked penne pasta. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve
          immediately
